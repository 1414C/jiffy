      <description>Execution Flags Jiffy requires a small number of flags to be specified at runtime.
 -m Inclusion of the -m flag instructs jiffy to build a new application using the specified model file. Jiffy expects a fully-qualified path to a model file to follow the -m flag. The -m and -mf flags are mutually exclusive. -mf Inclusion of the -mf flag instructs jiffy to read and process all model files contained in the specified folder.</description>
