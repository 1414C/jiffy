      <description>If you already have Go installed and know that your installation is working, you should skip to the next section. If you need to get Go installed on your machine, keep reading.
Go is easy to setup and can be installed from source or binary package, both which are available at golang.org. Jiffy is presently built and tested using golang version 1.14.3, and jiffy expects at least version 1.13. Jiffy uses go modules.</description>

      <description>If you want to try a small jiffy generated application without installing jiffy thats fine! Check out the libraryapp showcase to pull a docker image of a compiled jiffy application and follow the tutorial to test it out. If you want to install Jiffy and generate a services application yourself, keep reading!
Application Background Libraryapp exposes a Library entity and a Book entity in order to simplify the test-drive of a jiffy generated application.</description>

      <description>Install from Binary Distribution At the moment, the easiest way to install Jiffy is to pull down the binary distribution matching your build environment from the latest release area in the jiffy repository. There you will find builds of the jiffy executable for the following GOOS and GOARCH combinations.
   GOOS GOARCH FILE     darwin amd64 jiffy-darwin-amd64.tar.gz   linux amd64 jiffy-linux-amd64.tar.gz   linux arm jiffy-linux-arm.</description>

      <description>Now that Jiffy is installed, we will build a simple service to test it out.
Jiffys source tree comes with a number of sample model files that you can be used to get the hang of things. We are going to use a simple model file that contains an entity named &amp;lsquo;Person&amp;rsquo;. The model file can be found in the Jiffy source tree, or pulled directly from the Jiffy github repository.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s execute our first application!
cd $GOPATH/src/jiffy_tests/first_app go run main.go -dev -rs Executing with the -dev and -rs flags instructs our new application to initialize itself using the development configuration file, and forces a rebuild of the &amp;lsquo;Super&amp;rsquo; authorization-group. Consequently, some warning and info messages will scroll up the screen which is expected.
