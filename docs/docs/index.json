	"content": " Jiffy RESTful Services Generator Jiffy is a model-based RESTful application services generator written in go. It was developed as an experiment to offer an alternative avenue when developing native applications for SAP Hana. The jiffy application allows a developer to treat the data persistence layer as an abstraction, thereby removing the need to make use of CDS and the SAP XS libraries.\nWhile this is not for everybody, it does reduce the mental cost of entry and allows deployment of a web-based application on SAP Hana with virtually no prior Hana knowledge.\nMain Features  generated applications can be connected to Postgres, MSSQL, SAP Hana, SQLite or MariaDB with no source-code changes no database specific code is compiled into the binary bcrypt salt/pepper based authentication scheme session management and end-point authorizations via jwt built-in support for the creation of jwt signing-keys service end-points are secured by way of jwt claims in the route handler middleware service end-point security is generated by default JSON model file(s) for Entity, Index, Relationship and Foreign-Key definitions generates a set of CRUD-type RESTful services for each entity in the model file(s) built-in support for https getSet type end-points support /$count, $limit=n, $offset=n, $orderby=field_name ($asc|$desc) generates end-points for hasOne, hasMany and belongsTo entity relationships generates static query end-points each entity\u0026rsquo;s corresponding service can be enabled and disabled on a per app-server basis generated models support persistent and non-persistent fields generated apps create and alter backend database artifacts based on model definitions baked in normalization and validation in the model-layer generates a comprehensive set of working tests via go test generated code is easily extended either via direct editing, or through an extension-point concept  "
