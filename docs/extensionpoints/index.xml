      <description>Extension-Points (ext folders) The Jiffy application generates a working web services application based on the provided model files. While the generated application should be runnable immediately following generation, there is often a need to perform validation and normalization of the incoming data. This is best coded in the model-layer within the generated validation methods, but sometimes this is not sufficient.
There may be a need to inspect the request details immediately once the request has been passed to the controller.</description>

      <description>Overview Controller extension-points exist for the Create, Update and Get CRUD operations. Each operation has a related extension-point interface, for which an empty implementation is created when the application is generated. If the generator sees that the extension-point implementation file for an entity has already been created, it will not over-write or create a new version.
File ./myapp/controllers/ext/extc_interfaces.go contains the generated entity controller extension-point interface declarations. Each interface and interface method is documented in this file.</description>
