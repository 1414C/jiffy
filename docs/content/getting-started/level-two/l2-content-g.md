We have seen how to Create, Get, and Update a Person entity, but before we get around to the Delete operation, let's take a quick look at some other simple things we can do with Get entity lists.


{{%expand "Get a count of Person entities in the database" %}} ![person-count.jpg](../images/person-count.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database ordered-by age" %}} ![persons-orderby-age.jpg](../images/persons-orderby-age.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database ordered-by age descending" %}} ![persons-orderby-age-desc.jpg](../images/persons-orderby-age-desc.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database ordered-by age descending with a selection offset of 1" %}}![persons-orderby-age-desc-offset.jpg](../images/persons-orderby-age-desc-offset.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database ordered-by age descending with a limit of 2" %}}![persons-orderby-age-desc-limit.jpg](../images/persons-orderby-age-desc-limit.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database with name like %qui%" %}}![persons-name-like.jpg](../images/persons-name-like.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "Get all Person entities in the database with age equal to 46" %}}![persons-age-eq.jpg](../images/persons-age-eq.jpg) .{{% /expand%}}
